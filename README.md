# ðŸš€ IOT_Smart_Classroom_ESP32

A next-gen **smart classroom system** powered by **two ESP32 boards**:  
- **Sensor ESP32**: Handles **real-time student counting**, occupancy detection, and data updates.  
- **Controller ESP32**: Manages **door automation** (scheduled or password-based), **lighting**, and **fan control** â€“ all connected through **Firebase**.

### What it does:
- **Automated doors** open on schedule or with a password.
- **Live display** shows current time and number of students inside.
- **Lighting & fan** can be turned on/off directly from the mobile app.
- Data flows seamlessly via **Firebase** for instant updates.

### My Role:
- Built the **embedded system architecture**.
- Programmed both ESP32 boards for **sensor control** and **actuator management**.
- Integrated **servo motors, sensors, and real-time data streaming**.
- Ensured stable **app-to-device communication** and a fully functional smart classroom setup.

**Result:** A connected, automated classroom thatâ€™s secure, efficient, and fully controllable from anywhere.
